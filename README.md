# Recognition Numbers -> [0,9]

Welcome to the Number Recognition project! This project is designed to recognize and classify handwritten digits from 0 to 9 using machine learning.

Introduction:

This project aims to recognize handwritten digits [0-9] using a neural network. It is designed to be a simple, yet effective way to demonstrate the power of machine learning in image recognition tasks.

Features:

- Handwritten Digit Recognition: Accurately recognize digits from 0 to 9.
- Easy to Use: Simple interface for both training and inference.
- Extensible: Easy to extend and modify for other similar tasks.

Prerequisites:

Python 3.7 or higher
pip (Python package installer)

#Firstly we set up tensorflow for using in further steps, otherwise it is not possible to execute this code.
pip install tensorflow
